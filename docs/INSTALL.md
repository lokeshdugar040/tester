# Installing Rebound

Rebound runs in After Effects **2019 (16.0) or newer** on **Windows** and
**macOS**. There are two ways to install it: from a packaged `.zxp` (for users)
or from source (for development).

---

## 1. Install from a `.zxp` (users)

1. From the [Releases page](https://github.com/meszmate/rebound/releases),
   download the `.zxp` **for your operating system**:
   - macOS: `rebound_x.y.z_macos.zxp`
   - Windows: `rebound_x.y.z_windows.zxp`

   This matters. A ZXP is signed on the OS it is built on, and a ZXP signed on
   the *other* OS installs fine but renders **blank** (a documented Adobe
   signing issue). Grab the one that matches your machine.
2. Install it with any ZXP installer:
   - [ZXPInstaller](https://zxpinstaller.com/) (free, Windows + macOS), or
   - the [Anastasiy Extension Manager](https://install.anastasiy.com/).

   If the installer offers a choice, install **for the current user**, not for
   all users. The all-users location needs admin rights and a partial write
   there leaves the panel unable to find its files.
3. Quit and reopen After Effects (quit the whole app, not just the panel).
4. Open it from **Window ▸ Extensions ▸ Rebound**.

If the panel is blank or does not appear, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### If your installer does nothing

A `.zxp` is a signed zip, and extracting it into the extensions folder is a
valid install on its own, no installer required. This always works when
ZXPInstaller or Anastasiy silently fail (common on brand-new macOS builds).

**macOS**

```bash
D=~/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/com.meszmate.rebound
rm -rf "$D" && mkdir -p "$D"
unzip -o ~/Downloads/rebound_x.y.z_macos.zxp -d "$D"
```

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
$D = "$env:APPDATA\Adobe\CEP\extensions\com.meszmate.rebound"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $D -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Expand-Archive "$HOME\Downloads\rebound_x.y.z_windows.zxp" -DestinationPath $D
```

Then quit and reopen After Effects. (The signature travels inside the zip, so
the manually placed folder still verifies.)

---

## 2. Install from source (developers)

Requires **Node.js 20+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meszmate/rebound
cd rebound
npm install
```

### a. Enable CEP developer mode

After Effects refuses to load unsigned extensions unless *PlayerDebugMode* is
enabled. Rebound ships a helper that sets it for every relevant CEP version:

```bash
npm run debug:on     # enable
npm run debug:off    # disable later
```

<details>
<summary>What this changes (manual equivalent)</summary>

**Windows**, sets a registry string value for each CSXS version:

```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\CSXS.11  PlayerDebugMode = "1"
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\CSXS.12  PlayerDebugMode = "1"
```

**macOS**, writes a preference for each CSXS version and flushes the cache:

```bash
defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1
defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.12 PlayerDebugMode 1
killall cfprefsd
```

Use the CSXS version that matches your AE build (AE 2022–2024 → CSXS.11,
AE 2025 → CSXS.12). The helper sets 9–12 to be safe.
</details>

### b. Link the extension into the CEP folder

```bash
npm run install:dev          # symlink/junction the repo (live edits)
npm run install:dev -- --copy # or copy files instead
npm run uninstall:dev        # remove
```

This places (or links) the bundle at:

| OS | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Adobe\CEP\extensions\com.meszmate.rebound` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/com.meszmate.rebound` |

> On Windows the link is a directory **junction**, which doesn't need
> Administrator rights. If linking fails, run the terminal as Administrator or
> use `--copy`.

### c. Launch

Restart After Effects and open **Window ▸ Extensions ▸ Rebound**.

---

## 3. Building a `.zxp` yourself

Packaging needs Adobe's **ZXPSignCmd** (not redistributable here, download it
from [Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources)).
Put it on your PATH or set `REBOUND_ZXPSIGN` to its full path.

```bash
npm run cert     # one-time: create a self-signed cert.p12
npm run pack     # produces dist/rebound_x.y.z.zxp (timestamped signature)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Installed from a release and the panel is blank or missing?** Work down this
list; one of these is almost always it:

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Panel is blank / black (installed the ZXP) | You likely have the wrong OS's file. A ZXP signed on the other platform loads blank. Download the `_macos` build on macOS or the `_windows` build on Windows, reinstall, and fully restart AE. |
| Blank on macOS even with the right file | Gatekeeper quarantined it. Clear the flag: `xattr -cr ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/com.meszmate.rebound`, then restart AE. |
| Installer runs but no folder appears | ZXPInstaller silently failed (common on very new macOS). Try the [Anastasiy Extension Manager](https://install.anastasiy.com/), or use the manual install above; both are reliable. |
| `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` for `client/index.html` | A half-written install (usually an all-users install without admin rights). Delete the folder at that path and reinstall for the current user. |
| Panel missing from the Extensions menu | Reinstall for the current user, fully quit and reopen AE. If you built from source instead, confirm PlayerDebugMode is on for your AE's CSXS version. |
| "Rebound" loads but does nothing | The ExtendScript host failed to load; use the **⟳** (reload host) button in the header, or check the debugger console. |
| Panel says the bridge has no Node runtime | The manifest lost its `enable-nodejs` flag, usually from hand-editing `CSXS/manifest.xml`. Reinstall a release build. See [Do not strip the CEF flags](#do-not-strip-the-cef-flags). |

Extension locations (delete a stale/broken install here before reinstalling):

- macOS user: `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/com.meszmate.rebound`
- macOS all users: `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/com.meszmate.rebound`
- Windows user: `%APPDATA%\Adobe\CEP\extensions\com.meszmate.rebound`

### Do not strip the CEF flags

Advice circulates (AE 2026 / CEP 12 threads) that you should delete
`enable-nodejs` and `disable-gpu-compositing` from `CSXS/manifest.xml`. Do not
do this to a Rebound install. The reasoning behind it does not hold up:

- CEP 12 did not drop Node. Adobe's CEP 12 cookbook still ships Node 17.7.1 and
  still documents the flag. CEP 12 is also not new in AE 2026, it arrived in AE
  25.0, so a CEP 12 root cause could not spare AE 2025.
- `Heartbeat call failed` in the logs is a lost connection to the host, not a
  startup crash. See [Reading the CEP logs](#reading-the-cep-logs).
- `disable-gpu-compositing` is in the manifest to *fix* a blank paint (CEF was
  dropping the first raster of the inline SVG icons), not to cause one.

Removing `enable-nodejs` takes out the live Figma/Illustrator/Photoshop bridge,
every image in an import including offline `.rbir` files, and WAV onset
detection. `test/manifest.test.mjs` fails if either of those two flags, or
`allow-file-access-from-files`, goes missing from the panel extension.

If your panel is genuinely blank on AE 2026, work the table above first: the
wrong-OS ZXP and Gatekeeper quarantine are by far the most common causes.

**Building from source (developer symptoms):**

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Link step fails with `EPERM` (Windows) | Run the terminal as Administrator, or `npm run install:dev -- --copy`. |
| Changes don't show up | If you used `--copy`, re-run install; if you linked, just reload the panel (right-click ▸ Reload, or the ⟳ button). |
| Unsigned dev install rejected | Recent CEP verifies signatures even in debug mode. Use `npm run deploy` to install a signed copy instead of the dev symlink. |

### Remote debugging

With PlayerDebugMode enabled and the panel open in AE, read the `Port` value
from the `AEFT` host entry in the root `.debug` file, then open a Chromium-based
browser at `http://localhost:<Port>`. The current `.debug` configuration uses
`8088`; always use the value in that file if it differs. The page lists
inspectable targets; click **Rebound** to open DevTools against the live panel
(not the static `8099` browser preview). The target URL ending in
`client/index.html` is expected because it is the panel's manifest `MainPath`.

You get full DevTools (console, elements, network) against the live panel.
If DevTools reports a disconnected WebSocket after the panel reloads, reopen
the configured port and select **Rebound** again to attach to the current
target. The ExtendScript host is a separate runtime and does not appear in the
Chromium DOM inspector.

### Reading the CEP logs

When the panel misbehaves, the logs say more than the panel can. On macOS they
are in `~/Library/Logs/CSXS/`. On Windows they sit directly in `%TEMP%`
(`C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Temp`), with no `CSXS` subfolder:

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `CEP12-AEFT.log` | PlugPlug (the CEP host) loading extensions |
| `CEPHtmlEngine12-AEFT-<ver>-com.meszmate.rebound.panel.log` | the panel's browser process |
| `...panel-renderer.log` | the panel's renderer process, where page errors land |

Two lines that look alarming and are not:

- `ERROR ClientInitialized begin` / `end`. This is the normal successful boot.
  CEP logs it at ERROR level regardless.
- `ERROR Heartbeat call failed.` This means the renderer lost contact with the
  host. It is what you see after AE quits or the host stops responding, and it
  is not specific to Rebound or to any CEF flag. If it is preceded by
  `NSInvalidReceivePortException ... a mach port died`, AE went away first and
  the heartbeat is the consequence, not the cause.
